Time Complexity:

-> Each pointer moves only in one direction, and at most n steps total.
-> O(n)

Why not O(n²)?
Because we never restart either pointer.
We only shrink the search space from both ends.
This is why two pointers is optimal for sorted arrays.

Space Complexity:

We only use:
-> a few variables (left, right, sum)
-> no extra arrays
-> no hash maps
Everything is done in-place inside the original array.
Final space complexity:
O(1)
